    <h3>Author's Note</h3>
    <p>
      This dictionary project is dedicated to the preservation and growth of the Vaiphei language. 
      It is designed as a bridge for learners, researchers, and everyday users who wish to better 
      understand the richness of Vaiphei and English side by side. The work represents years of 
      dedication and effort to collect, organize, and make the vocabulary accessible in a digital form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language is more than communication—it is the soul of a community. With every word preserved, 
      a piece of identity and culture is safeguarded for the future generations. It is my humble hope 
      that this project will inspire younger Vaiphei speakers to value their mother tongue while also 
      helping outsiders learn and appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is not perfect and will continue to grow. Feedback, corrections, and contributions 
      from users are always welcome. Together, we can make this dictionary stronger and more useful 
      for schools, churches, researchers, and families alike.
